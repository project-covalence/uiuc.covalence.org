## Background

### What is Covalence?

Covalence is a community of students and young adults across the WORLD who want to contribute towards alleviating the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we encourage students all around the world to share their efforts on how they are combating COVID-19 and give other students and young adults ideas and opportunities on how they can help out as well.

### What is the purpose of this movement?

COVID-19 is REAL, DEVASTATING, and getting WORSE by the day. The repercussions will reverberate through our society for months, even years to come. With our current measures, 60,000 people will die from COVID-19, many of them alone in their hospital beds without the solace of their loved ones. Our front line workers bear the brunt of the emotional and physical toll. They risk their lives everyday, working to exhaustion without adequate protection whilst constantly witnessing the horrors of death.

As students and young adults, many of us may feel helpless at home while watching the world outside being ravaged by the pandemic. However, there is actually so much that we CAN do to contribute to the situation, however large or small the effort may be. We have the drive, skills, and creativity to devise new solutions to unaddressed issues, emulate existing solutions in our own communities, and contribute towards ongoing efforts battling COVID-19. With the collaboration of all of us, we can alleviate the impact of COVID-19 and save help communities around the world.

Let’s do our part and help our communities get through this together!
